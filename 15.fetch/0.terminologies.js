3-Tier Architecture: This is a way of organizing an application into three layers: the presentation layer (user interface), the business logic layer (where the processing happens), and the data layer (where the information is stored). Each layer is responsible for a specific task, making it easier to manage and update the system. This separation helps in scaling the app and making it more maintainable.

API: API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is like a set of rules that allows different software programs to talk to each other. An API defines how requests and responses should be structured, so one program can send information to another and get back the right result.

HTTP: HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is the protocol used by the web to transfer data between a user's browser and a web server. When you visit a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server sends back an HTTP response with the webpage.

Status Codes: Status codes are three-digit numbers sent by a server in response to a request. They tell the client (browser) whether the request was successful or if something went wrong. For example, a 200 code means everything is fine, and a 404 code means the page wasnâ€™t found.

Fetch API: The Fetch API is a modern way for web browsers to request data from servers. It allows you to get or send data to a server using JavaScript in a simple and clean way, often used for interacting with APIs. It returns promises, which makes it easier to handle results or errors asynchronously.
